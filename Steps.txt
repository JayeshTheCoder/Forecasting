Steps
1. Identify one cost element                                                                       = Done
2. Spread Monthly data into weekly data for last 2 years and current year till date                = Done
3. Check for stationarity (perform stationarity dickey-tuller test)
4. if required stationarize the data
5. Then check for trends like seasonality, noise and cyclicity trend analysis
6. Decide and try atleast 3-4 model constructs
6a. Moving average
6b. Exponential Smoothing
6c. ARIMA and S-ARIMA if seasonality exists
6d. FB Prophet
7. Finalize the model construct
8. Check for model accuracy
9. Try for a few more cost elements
10. Review
